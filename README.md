# powerstore-api-emulator
Basic emulator of DellEMC PowerStore REST API provisioning functions developed for educational purposes

## Description
It allows you to get familiar with the basics programming with the DellEMC PowerStore REST API. It implements the following API calls that cover some basic information gathering and the fundamentals of block provisioning:

- GET /cluster
- GET /event
- GET /host
- GET /host/<host_id>
- POST /host
- DELETE /host/<host_id>
- GET /volume
- GET /volume/<vol_id>
- POST /volume
- PATCH /volume/<vol_id>
- POST /volume/<vol_id>/attach
- DELETE /volume/<vol_id>
- GET /host_volume_mapping

Information for the cluster and the event calls is static but the information about hosts, volumes and mappings can be edited through the API calls. Data is imported from the "data.py" file, loaded into memory and lasts until you stop the emulator. Changes are not persisted for the next run

In order to help you interact with the emulator the following resources have been provided:
 - Sample collection in the Postman folder
 - Sample playbooks in the Ansible folder. The playbooks successfully behave idempotently like the real array. As playbooks run you can see all the different API calls the Ansible modules perform in order to ensure idempotency

## Requirements
The code has been developed with Python 3.9.2. It has also been tested with Python 3.6.8

Python package requirements are mostly Flask and PyOpenSSL. You can install the specific versions with the included requirements.txt

The Ansible playbooks have been tested with Ansible version 2.9.9 and version 1.1 of the PowerStore Ansible modules. Other users have tested successfully Ansible modules version 1.2.1 as well. However some changes were introduced in version 1.4.0 that will try to make use of certain API calls (such as /logout, /login_session and /software_installed) that are not implemented in the emulator and will cause the Ansible modules to fail. So please avoid 1.4.0 and later

## Known limitations
- Only a single field will be used for matching
- Only "eq." rules for matching
- Not checking if the new volume size is larger than current size during a PATCH
- Not checking whether a host has volume mappings during a DELETE /volume
- Not enforcing mandatory parameters when creating resources
- ... and a few more
